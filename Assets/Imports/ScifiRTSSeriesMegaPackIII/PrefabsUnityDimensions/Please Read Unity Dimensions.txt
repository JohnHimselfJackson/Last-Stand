The prefabs in this folder are intended to be used as stand alone models. they are scaled to unity 
dimensions and are at least two unity units big.



If you want to use the models together with my other RTS Series models like "Tanks" or
"Artillery" you should use the prefabs in the folder: 

					"Prefabs"

The prefabs in the above mentioned folder are scaled smaller so that the models sizes are
in relation to each other.
