The prefabs in this folder are intended to be used with my other RTS Series models, e.g. tanks 
 or artillery.

The models are ca. 1-3 unity units big.


If you want to use these models separately you should use the prefabs in the folder: 

			"PrefabsUnityDimensions"

The prefabs in the above mentioned folder are scaled bigger so that each models is at least two unity units big.
